# kapla

to run server :npm run dev

I have assigned csv data file as
name,gender,phonenumber
sathwik,m,9959323385
rohith,m,8522935434
karthik,m,9984525458
arun,m,9866018456

First I was registered as user and then loggedin through postman and through postman I sent a post request of this csv file through Form data and Uploaded to node server and then inserted data into mongodb.Then next I performed crud commands through postman.


I have used mvc structure for coding.

I have used jwt authentication for middleware.

.env should not upload but you may run and test so I have kept that also.
